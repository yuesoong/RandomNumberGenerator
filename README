Here is the code written for the project of CS55, Security and Privacy.

My project is about the analysis and implementation of some random
number generator.

mersenne.c implements Mersenne Twister:
	   run example: ./mersenne 500

kiss.c implements Multiply With Carry:
       run example: ./kiss 500

linear.c implements Linear congruential generator:
	 run example: ./linear 500
